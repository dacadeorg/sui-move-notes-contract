## Setup

### Install Sui
```
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch devnet sui
```

### Install dev tools
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --branch sui-move --features "address32"

brew install libpq
```

### Run a local network
```
git clone --branch devnet https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git

cd sui

RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" cargo run --bin sui-test-validator
```

### Create addresses
For this tutorial we need two separate addresses. To create an address run this command in the terminal:
```
sui client new-address ed25519
```
where:
- `ed25519` is the key scheme (other available options are: `ed25519`, `secp256k1`, `secp256r1`)

And the output should be similar to this:
```
╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Created new keypair and saved it to keystore.                                                   │
├────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ address        │ 0x05db1e318f1e4bc19eb3f2fa407b3ebe1e7c3cd8147665aacf2595201f731519             │
│ keyScheme      │ ed25519                                                                        │
│ recoveryPhrase │ lava perfect chef million beef mean drama guide achieve garden umbrella second │
╰────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```
Use `recoveryPhrase` words to import the address to the wallet app.


### Get localnet SUI tokens
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```
`<ADDRESS>` - replace this by the output of this command that returns the active address:
```
sui client active-address
```

You can switch to another address by running this command:
```
sui client switch --address <ADDRESS>
```
abd run the HTTP request to mint some SUI tokens to this account as well.

Also, you can top up the balance via the wallet app. To do that, you need to import an account to the wallet.

## Build and publish a smart contract

### Build package
To build tha package, you should run this command:
```
sui move build
```

If the package is built successfully, the next step is to publish the package:
### Publish package
```
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 --json
```
Here we do not specify the path to the package dir so it will use the current dir - `.`
